Challenge: When looking up a student, it will also display the class schedule for that student going to that school with at least 3 classes. You don't need to have periods, just the class names are fine.  You will need to generate a random class schedule for each student.  You can add and remove classes from their schedule.  You can do this however you like.   One way is to modify the map <key,value> from <Profile,String> to <Profile,SchoolInfo> and SchoolInfo will be a class containing the school and student schedule.
